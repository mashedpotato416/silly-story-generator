Silly Story Generator

----------------------

Project Brief:<br>

You have been provided with some raw HTML/CSS and a few text strings and JavaScript functions; you need to write the necessary JavaScript to turn this into a working program, which does the following: <br>

-Generates a silly story when the "Generate random story" button is pressed.<br>
-Replaces the default name "Bob" in the story with a custom name, only if a custom name is entered into  the "Enter custom name" text field before the generate button is pressed.<br>
-Converts the default US weight and temperature quantities and units in the story into UK equivalents if the UK radio button is checked before the generate button is pressed.<br>
-Will generate another random silly story if you press the button again (and again...)
